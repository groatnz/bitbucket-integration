Github Tips
If you need to clone another, private repo while executing your actions:

 

1. create a "personal access token" (via your account settings, "Developer settings", "Personal access tokens").

2. copy the created token, and add it as a secret to the repository in which the action is going to be executed with a name such as "ACCESS_TOKEN"

3. add something like the following to your action.yml:

 

- uses: actions/checkout@v1
  with:
    repository: my-private/repo-name
    token: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
